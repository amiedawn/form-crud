# Form CRUD

This application accepts data from a form and then saves a record in the table below. Buttons appear to edit and delete a record, but those functionalities will not work until the next version in "Object CRUD."

For now, the application includes the ability to add the record by either hitting enter or clicking on the "Add Record" button. All name fields are required and email validation is included.
